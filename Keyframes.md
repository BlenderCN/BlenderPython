Keyframing is a massive topic. I fear not everything can be covered explicitly, but implicitly by understanding these examples the rest will also makes sense.  

-  "datapath"    
-  keyframe object properties (like location, scale, rotation, hide_render)  
-  keyframe mesh content (move vertices by keyframe)  
-  keyframe miscellaneous  

mention constant interpolation (this avoids the need to place a before and after keyframe)
