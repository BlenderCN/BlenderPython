This is a crash course in the Python subset. If you already master these you should not waste time reading this, unless you want to check for typos or factual inaccuracies.

### How to run this code  

(elaborate) : Open Blender, and get a Python console view open. You'll notice `>>>` , this is a prompt waiting for you to type stuff. What we'll be doing below is type stuff after the prompt, then hit Enter to run it.


###print

An important way to debug your code, it doesn't discriminate between beginners and pros. While you learn Python `print()` is your friend. It will try to display whatever is between the parenthesis `( )`.

```python
>>> print("Hello apprentice")
...Hello apprentice
```

I'll return to `print()` frequently on this page to show how to display information that you will find helpful while coding.
