Welcome to the Blender Python Recipes wiki!  
_curated and opinionated snippets for bpy_  
**(Work In Progress until this message goes)**

Scripting examples are listed in the section to the right.

**Why Recipes?**   
The `bpy` documentation is mostly auto-generated and tends to be (October 2015) rather sparse on details; that's fine for most confident python-heads, but people trying to learn python and `bpy`  benefit more from seeing many short samples. A github _markdown based_ wiki is a convenient way to collect snippets and allow people to contribute updates and fixes.

**Who?**   
The snippets assume some familiarity with Python, some more than others. If you are pretty new to Python you'll probably pick up a lot of techniques by experimenting with the examples and breaking / fixing them. The aim here isn't strictly to teach Python, but sometimes techniques are described or Python docs are referenced. Mostly the examples expect some familiarity with Blender, or that you want to automate something that you understand how to do with the UI.

**What?**  
Some of these snippets are written for one off projects, others are taken from code collected at Blenderscripting.blogspot or answers given on Blender.stackexchange.

**Contribute?**  
I have no interest in doing this alone. Make a new issue about a topic if you think it can be augmented with more information. Content will not be included without consent of whoever wrote the code, I will assume any contributors have the right to submit code, submissions found to ignore this request will be rewritten or removed.
