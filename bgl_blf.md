This topic is something people tend to gravitate towards once they've grasped the notions of Meshes:  vertices, normals, indices, Vectors and Matrices - and the trigonometry and LinearAlgebra used to perform calculations / transformations on them. This page will assume you are at that stage.

Else there is [further reading](Further_Reading_LA) to accompany this if things aren't making sense.

2d text in the viewport is drawn using `blf` see below.

## BGL

This is a python wrapper around openGL drawing commands. openGL is a big topic, but once you understand the elementary concepts (which I intend to cover here) the learning curve for new openGL concepts gets less steep. It's possible to accomplish a lot without really knowing much about how openGL or the wrapper works.

You want to draw stuff.
