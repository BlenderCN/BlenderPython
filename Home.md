Welcome to the Blender Python Recipes wiki!  
_curated and opinionated snippets for bpy_  
**(Work In Progress until this message goes)**

Scripting examples are listed in the section to the right.

**Why Recipes?**   
The `bpy` documentation is mostly auto-generated and tends to be (October 2015) rather sparse on details; that's fine for most confident python-heads, but people trying to learn python and `bpy`  benefit more from seeing many short samples. A github _markdown based_ wiki is a convenient way to collect snippets and allow people to contribute updates and fixes.

**Who?**   
The snippets assume some familiarity with Python and Blender terminology. If you are new to Python you might pick up a lot of techniques by experimenting with the examples and breaking / fixing / augmenting them. The aim here isn't strictly to teach Python, but Python docs are referenced when it makes sense. 

**What?**  
Some of these snippets are written for one off projects, others are taken from code collected at Blenderscripting.blogspot or answers given on Blender.stackexchange.

**Contribute?**  
I have no interest in doing this alone. Make a new issue about a topic if you think it can be augmented with more information. Content will not be included without consent of whoever wrote the code, I will assume any contributors have the right to submit code, submissions found to ignore this request will be rewritten or removed.
