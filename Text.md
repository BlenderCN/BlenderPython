### Text Objects / Font Objects

In Blender terms _Text Objects_ are _Font Objects_, and both refer to the same thing. They are of type `type == 'FONT'`, and closely related to the Curve Object type. The individual glyphs can't be edited until converted to `type=='CURVE'`. Text Objects have many parameters. The most important parameter of the Font type is possibly the font face. Confusingly this is called the font _type_. Like Helvetica vs Gill Sans.
