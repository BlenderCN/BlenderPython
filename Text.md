### Text Objects / Font Objects

In Blender terms _Text Objects_ are _Font Objects_, and both refer to the same thing. They are of type `type == 'FONT'`, and closely related to the Curve Object type. Text Objects are another object type that has many parametric ways to modify it. The most important parameter of the Font type is possibly the font face. Confusingly this is called the font _type_. Like Helvetica vs Gill Sans.
