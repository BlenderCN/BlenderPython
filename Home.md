Welcome to the Blender Python Recipes wiki!  
_curated and opinionated snippets for bpy_  
**(Work In Progress until this message goes)**

Scripting examples are listed in the section to the right.

**Why Recipes?**   
Because this may be the most convenient way to collect snippets and allow people to contribute updates and fixes. The bpy documentation is mostly auto-generated and tends to be (October 2015) rather sparse on details; that's fine for weather python-heads, but people trying to figure bpy out can benefit more from seeing examples worked out.

**Who?**   
The snippets assume some familiarity with Python, some more than others. If you are pretty new to Python you'll probably pick up a lot of techniques by experimenting with the examples and breaking / fixing them.

**What?**  
Some are written for one off projects, others are taken from snippets at Blenderscripting.blogspot or answers given on Blender.stackexchange.

**Contribute?**  
I have no interest in doing all this alone. Make a new issue about a topic if you think it can be augmented with more information.
